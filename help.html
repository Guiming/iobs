    <div id="into">This interface was designed to aid citizens to contribute data on wildlife sightings which we name  as <b>citizen observations</b>. <i>Citizen observations</i> are captured as <b>sighting polygons</b> and <b>activity roures</b>. The interface itself should be straightforward enough. Therefore you might skip the following guidelines. But for your reference, here are some tips for you. You can <b>get back here</b> at any time by click the help icon <img src="img/info_off.png"> on the up right corner.</div>

    <h3>About the interface</h3>
        <li><p>This interface contains a base map, map controls, and a tool bar. In default, the base map shows high resolution satellite imagery of the focus area. You can play with the map to situate yourself in this area and recall your sightings of wildlife. The tool bar <img src="img/tool_bar.png"> is mainly for you to draw polygons that indicate where the wildlife was sighted, as well as to draw your activity routes in this area.</p></li>
        
    <h3>Basic map interaction</h3>    
        <li><p>As you can see, the map is the big part of this interface. Geting familiar with basic map interaction first would help to promote your productivity.</p></li>
        <li><p>You can <b>zoom</b> in or zoom out by using <img src="img/zoom_in.png"> and <img src="img/zoom_out.png"> on the up left corner. Zoom in or out can be achieved by your mouse wheel too.</p></li> 
        
        <li><p><b>Pan</b> or move the map is quite straightforward. You can hold the left mouse button down and drag to move the map. Or, you can activate the pan control <img src="img/pan_off.png"> on the tool bar on the right top corner. If the pan control is activated, the icon would change to  <img src="img/pan_on.png"></p></li>
        
        <li><p><b>Layer swither</b> control <img src="img/layer_switcher.png"> at the lower part of up right corner is for you to switch the satellite imagery map to a topographic map, or a hybrid one which has roads and labels overlayed on top of the satellite imagery. The topographic map presents the focus area in 3D which might be more intuitive to give you an impression of the terrain conditons. We <i>highly recommend</i> you to use satellite imagery and 3D topographic map, in combination, in the following data contributing processes.</p></li>
    
        <li><p>A <b>scale bar</b> <img src="img/scale_bar.png"> at the bottom right corner indicates the scale of the current map view.</p></li>

    <h3>Create citizen observations</h3>
        <li><p>Your sightings of wildlife will be recorded as sighting polygons indicating the approximate spatial location where sighted wildlife presented. You can start drawing such polygons by activating the <b>draw sighting polygon</b> control <img src="img/draw_polygon_off.png"> on the tool bar. Once it is active <img src="img/draw_polygon_on.png">, you can draw polygons on top of the map.</p></li>
        <li><p>If it is the first polygon or route you are drawing, a prompt will come out asking you for some basic information that is needed for associating the data record with you. Your provision of such information is preferred but on a voluntary basis.</p></li>
        <li><p>Please keep in mind that these polygons represent the extent of spatial locaton where the wildlife presented. Therefore you should spatially locate polygons as precise as possible. After finishing the sketch of a polygon, you will be prompted for details on this record of wildlife sighting, such as the sighting date, number of wildlife.</p></li> 
        <li><p>A drawn polygon can be modified with the <b>modify sighting polygons</b> control <img src="img/edit_polygon_off.png"> on the tool bar. Once it is activited <img src="img/edit_polygon_on.png">, you can edit the vertices of the polygon. You can also delete a drawn polygon with <b>delete polygon or route</b> control activated <img src="img/delete_on.png">.</p></li>

    <li><p>Acitivity routes are the routes you took in the focus area both on which you sighted wildlife and on which you did not sight any wildlife. An activity route can be drawn in a similar way with drawing a sighting polygon. Use <b>draw activity route</b> control <img src="img/draw_line_on.png"> on the tool bar to sketch an activity route. Use <b>modify activity route</b> control <img src="img/edit_line_on.png"> to modify the sketch of an activity route. Use <b>delete polygon or route</b> control <img src="img/delete_on.png"> to delete an activity route.</p></li>

    <h3>Make a map!</h3>
    <li><p>You might noticed that we have not talked about one button on the tool bar. Yes, you are right! We save that button to <b>make a map</b> based on your citizen observations. After you finish drawing sighting polygons and activity routes, hit that button <img src="img/make_a_map.png"> on the tool bar to predict a habitat suitability map using the data you just contributed. Isn't it so cool?</p></li>
